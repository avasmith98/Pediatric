This 6-month, open-label extension study of a previously described base study compared oral montelukast with inhaled beclomethasone in terms of safety, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) measurements, parent and patient satisfaction with treatment, asthma-related medical resource utilization, school absenteeism, and parental work loss in children with asthma. A total of 124 of 266 asthmatic children, 6 to 11 years of age, who enrolled in the base study entered a 6-month open-label extension study (74 boys, 50 girls) and were re-randomized (2:1 ratio) to receive once-daily oral montelukast (n = 83) or inhaled beclomethasone 100 mcg three times daily (n = 41). Children were evaluated in the clinic prior to re-randomization (Month 0) and at regular visits at 1, 3, and 6 months. Children and their parents showed a significantly higher overall satisfaction for montelukast at 6 months than for inhaled beclomethasone (p = 0.001 and p < 0.05, respectively). According to parents, montelukast was more convenient (p < 0.001), less difficult to use (p = 0.005), and was used as instructed more of the time (p = 0.006) compared with beclomethasone. Oral corticosteroid use was similar in the montelukast (13% of patients) and beclomethasone (17%) treatment groups. The montelukast treatment group was more adherent with their regimen than the inhaled beclomethasone treatment group; almost twice as many children on montelukast compared with inhaled beclomethasone were highly compliant (82% versus 45%). The two study groups were similar with respect to overall safety, change in FEV1, asthma-related medical resource utilization, school absenteeism, and parental work loss. Montelukast represents a safe and effective asthma treatment regimen to which children with asthma are more likely to adhere. [PMID: 11759189, J F Maspero et al., 2001] Montelukast is a potent leukotriene-receptor antagonist administered once daily that provides clinical benefit in the treatment of asthma and allergic rhinitis in children and adults. Because of its wide use as a pediatric controller, there is a need for a further review of the safety and tolerability of montelukast in children. To summarize safety and tolerability data for montelukast from previously reported as well as from unpublished placebo-controlled, double-blind, pediatric studies and their active-controlled open-label extension/extended studies. These studies evaluated 2,751 pediatric patients 6 months to 14 years of age with persistent asthma, intermittent asthma associated with upper respiratory infection, or allergic rhinitis. These patients were enrolled in seven randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind registration and post-registration studies and three active-controlled open-label extension/extended studies conducted by Merck Research Laboratories between 1995 and 2004. Montelukast was well tolerated in all studies. Clinical and laboratory adverse experiences for patients treated with montelukast were generally mild and transient. The most frequent clinical adverse events for all treatments (placebo, montelukast, active control/usual care) in virtually all studies were upper respiratory infection, worsening asthma, pharyngitis, and fever. The clinical and laboratory safety profile for montelukast was similar to that observed for placebo or active control/usual care therapies. The safety profile of montelukast did not change with long-term use. [PMID: 19449366, Hans Bisgaard et al., 2009] Current American Academy of Pediatrics Guidelines recommended that statins should be considered as a first-line agent in children as early as 8 years of age. The aim of our work is to assess the safety of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors in children with hypercholesterolaemia. Controlled studies in children show that statin monotherapy is efficacious, well tolerated and safe in the short-time. Unfortunately, these studies have relatively short-term follow-up periods, and therefore, long-term safety remains unclear. [PMID: 23631461, Norman Lamaida et al., 2013] To date, only one study of chronic use of a leukotriene receptor antagonist in children has been published. The efficacy and safety of montelukast in children 6-14 years of age with asthma (n = 336) was studied during an 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. There was significantly greater improvement in forced expired volume in 1 sec (FEV(1)) from baseline for the montelukast group (8. 23%) compared to the placebo group (3.58%). There was a significant decrease in use of beta agonists for symptom relief and a significant decrease in the percentage of days and percentage of patients with asthma exacerbations. An asthma-specific quality of life questionnaire revealed significant overall improvement in quality of life and significant improvement in the quality of life domains for symptoms, activity, and emotions. Adverse effects were not significantly different for montelukast than for placebo, with the exception of allergic rhinitis which was more prevalent in the placebo group. A 6-month open follow-up of patients from the above study was undertaken. Effects of montelukast on FEV(1) were consistent over the 6 months, with the increase in FEV(1) not significantly different from a small control group treated with beclomethasone. Quality of life remained significantly improved throughout the open treatment period. In conclusion, leukotriene receptor antagonists are of value for the treatment of children with asthma. [PMID: 10922144, A Becker et al., 2000] The aim of this article is to review data on the efficacy and safety of montelukast in the treatment of children with asthma. Available published literature, including published abstracts, is reviewed. In patients aged 6 to 14 years with asthma (n = 27), montelukast 5mg demonstrated a significant decrease in exercise-induced bronchoconstriction 20 to 24 hours postdose after 2 days of treatment. For children with chronic asthma, only one study of the regular use of a leukotriene receptor antagonist has been published. The efficacy and safety of montelukast in children aged 6 to 14 years with asthma (n = 336) were studied during an 8-week, double-blind, placebocontrolled trial. There was a significantly greater improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) from baseline for the montelukast group (8.23%) compared with the placebo group (3.58%). There was a significant decrease in the use of a 3-agonist for symptom relief, as well as in the percentage of days and percentage of patients with asthma exacerbations. An asthma specific quality-of-life (QOL) questionnaire revealed a significant overall improvement in QOL and a significant improvement in the QOL domains for symptoms, activity and emotions in montelukast recipients. There was no significant difference between montelukast and placebo recipients in the frequency of adverse events, with the exception of allergic rhinitis, which was more prevalent in the placebo group. An open label follow-up of patients from the above study was undertaken. The effect of montelukast on FEV1 was consistent for up to 1.4 years, with the increase in FEV1 being not significantly different from that in a small control group treated with inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate. QOL remained significantly improved during the open treatment period. Montelukast appears effective and safe for the treatment of children with asthma. [PMID: 10741880, A Becker et al., 2000] Topical tacrolimus is used off-label in young children, but data are limited on its use in children under 2 years of age and for long-term treatment. To compare safety differences between topical tacrolimus (0.03% and 0.1% ointments) and topical corticosteroids (mild and moderate potency) in young children with atopic dermatitis (AD). We conducted a 36-month follow-up study with 152 young children aged 1-3 years with moderate to severe AD. The children were followed up prospectively, and data were collected on infections, disease severity, growth parameters, vaccination responses and other relevant laboratory tests were gathered. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for skin-related infections (SRIs) (P = 0.20), non-SRIs (P = 0.20), growth parameters height (P = 0.60), body weight (P = 0.81), Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) (P = 0.19), vaccination responses (P = 0.62), serum cortisone levels (P = 0.23) or serum levels of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, IL-12, IL-31 and interferon-γ. EASI decreased significantly in both groups (P < 0.001). In the tacrolimus group, nine patients (11.68%) had detectable tacrolimus blood concentrations at the 1-week visit. There were no malignancies or severe infections during the study, and blood eosinophil counts were similar in both groups. Topical tacrolimus (0.03% and 0.1%) and topical corticosteroids (mild and moderate potency) are safe to use in young children with moderate to severe AD, and have comparable efficacy and safety profiles. [PMID: 34798685, A Salava et al., 2022] To describe a new test for vesicoureteric reflux in children and assess patient preference compared to indirect radionuclide cystography. One hundred and three toilet-trained children aged between 2.1 and 15.6 years underwent percutaneous injection of 10-20 MBq of 99m-technetium-labelled mercapto-acetyl-triglycine (MAG3) into the full bladder after the application of anaesthetic cream. Gamma camera images of the bladder and renal areas were recorded during a 5-min resting period and during micturition. All procedures were successful, 97 with a single stab. Fifty-four of the 66 children who expressed a preference preferred percutaneous suprapubic injection to intravenous injection. Images were easy to interpret and there were no indeterminate results. Of 200 renal units, 33 refluxed during the resting phase and 31 during micturition. In 24 renal units, reflux was only demonstrated during the resting phase. Reflux was significantly associated with abnormalities on dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans ( P<0.001). The new technique of direct percutaneous radionuclide cystography is described. It was well tolerated by patients. It detects reflux during the resting phase that would be missed on the indirect study and avoids doubt as to whether activity in the renal areas is due to reflux or excretion. Free pertechnetate could be used and would be much cheaper. [PMID: 12107585, A Graham Wilkinson et al., 2002] Lidocaine and prilocaine are local anesthetics, a class of medications which are frequently used in clinical medicine to minimize pain in a variety of procedures. They are commonly found in over-the-counter products such as topical anesthetic creams advertised to relieve localized muscle and joint pain. While safe and well-tolerated when used appropriately, an overdose of these anesthetics increases the risk for local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST), which in severe cases can present with seizures, cardiac dysrhythmias, and ultimately cardiovascular collapse. The reduced muscle mass of pediatric patients puts them at an increased risk of LAST due to the depot effect of the systemically absorbed anesthetic. Methemoglobinemia may also be associated with local anesthetic toxicity. Our case involves a previously healthy 15-month-old female who presented to one of our networks' emergency departments in status epilepticus following an accidental ingestion of a tube of 2.5% lidocaine/2.5% prilocaine cream. Her seizure activity was initially resistant to intraosseous benzodiazepine administration, but ultimately resolved following administration of lipid emulsion and sodium bicarbonate. Additionally, the patient had refractory hypoxia on the monitor which resolved shortly after administration of methylene blue. After stabilization, the patient was transferred to the Pediatric ICU and ultimately made a complete recovery. LAST is a life-threatening presentation which requires early recognition by clinicians, as well as an understanding of the appropriate treatment modalities. We review the assessment and management of LAST, with special focus on the pediatric patient. [PMID: 34742600, Kathleen McMahon et al., 2022] Locust bean gum (LBG) is a galactomannan polysaccharide used as thickener in infant formulas with the therapeutic aim to treat uncomplicated gastroesophageal reflux (GER). Since its use in young infants below 12weeks of age is not explicitly covered by the current scientific concept of the derivation of health based guidance values, the present integrated safety review aimed to compile all the relevant preclinical toxicological studies and to combine them with substantial evidence gathered from the clinical paediatric use as part of the weight of evidence supporting the safety in young infants below 12weeks of age. LBG was demonstrated to have very low toxicity in preclinical studies mainly resulting from its indigestible nature leading to negligible systemic bioavailability and only possibly influencing tolerance. A standard therapeutic level of 0.5g/100mL in thickened infant formula is shown to confer a sufficiently protective Margin of Safety. LBG was not associated with any adverse toxic or nutritional effects in healthy term infants, while there are limited case-reports of possible adverse effects in preterms receiving the thickener inappropriately. Altogether, it can be concluded that LBG is safe for its intended therapeutic use in term-born infants to treat uncomplicated regurgitation from birth onwards.  [PMID: 24997231, Leo Meunier et al., 2014] Pruritus is a severe symptom accompanying chronic cholestasis. It can be debilitating and difficult to control. In children, first-line treatments are ursodeoxycholic acid and rifampicin. Refractory pruritus may require invasive therapies including liver transplantation. Clinical trials based on small samples of adult patients suggest that serotonin reuptake inhibitors can improve pruritus in cholestatic or uremic disease. We performed a prospective, multicenter study to assess efficiency and safety of the serotonin reuptake inhibitor sertraline in treating children with refractory cholestatic pruritus. Twenty children experiencing refractory cholestatic pruritus related to Alagille syndrome or progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis were included from 4 centers between 2007 and 2014, and treated with sertraline at a starting dose of 1 mg · kg · day and thereafter individually adapted up to 4 mg · kg · day. Before and after 3 months with therapy, pruritus was assessed using a visual itching scale graded on 10 points, a skin scratch marks score and a sleeping impairment score. Sertraline was prescribed at a median daily dose of 2.2 mg · kg · day. After 3 months, pruritus improved in 14 out of 20 treated patients, and the median itching score decreased significantly from 8/10 (5-10) to 5/10 (2-10). Likewise, skin scratch marks and sleep quality improved in 9 of these 14 patients. Nonsevere adverse events were reported in 6 children, leading to treatment discontinuation in 3. Our data suggest that sertraline may constitute a useful drug in the management of refractory cholestatic pruritus in children. [PMID: 27557426, Alice Thébaut et al., 2017] This is a multicenter, open-label, add-on trial, investigating the safety and efficacy of ganaxolone (GNX) in a population of children with refractory infantile spasms, or with continuing seizures after a prior history of infantile spasms. A total of 20 children aged 7 months to 7 years were enrolled in this dose-escalation study, after baseline seizure frequencies were established. Concomitant antiepilepsy drugs were maintained throughout the study period. The dose of GNX was progressively increased to 36 mg/kg/d (or to the maximally tolerated dose) over a period of 4 weeks, then maintained for 8 weeks before tapering and discontinuation. Seizure diaries were maintained by the families, and spasm frequency was compared with the baseline period. The occurrence of adverse events was clinically monitored, and global evaluations of seizure severity and response to treatment were obtained. A total of 16 of the 20 subjects completed the study, 15 of whom had refractory infantile spasms at the time of study enrollment. Spasm frequency was reduced by at least 50% in 33% of these subjects, with an additional 33% experiencing some improvement (25-50% reduction in spasm frequency). Ganaxolone was well tolerated, and adverse events attributed to GNX were generally mild. Ganaxolone was safe and effective in treating this group of refractory infantile spasms patients in an open-label, add-on trial. Further investigation with randomized, controlled study design is warranted. [PMID: 11074186, J F Kerrigan et al., 2000] To determine the therapeutic effectiveness and safety of polyethylene glycol 4000 (forlax) in the treatment of constipation in children over 8 years old. This study was designed as a randomized, positive medicine (lactulose) controlled multicenter trial. A total of 216 children with constipation from 8-18 years old from 7 hospitals across China who were matched with a uniform entry criteria were enrolled in this study. The 216 patients were randomized to receive either oral forlax (20 g/d, n=105) or lactulose (15 mL/d, n=111) for 2 weeks. The therapeutic effects, including bowel movement frequency, stool consistency, clinical complete remission rate of constipation and abdominal symptoms, and the safety of forlax and lactulose were evaluated at 1 and 2 weeks of treatment. The median weekly frequency of bowel movement in the forlax group increased by 4 and 5 times respectively after 1 and 2 weeks of treatment, and increased by 3 and 4 times in the lactulose group (P < 0.05). The stool consistency of the two groups was both improved significantly after treatment. The Bristol score of stool consistency of the forlax and lactulose groups were 3.41+/-1.11 and 3.64+/-1.33 respectively (P < 0.05) after 1 week of treatment, and were 4.26+/-0.89 and 3.63+/-1.33 respectively (P < 0.05) after 2 weeks of treatment. The clinical complete remission rate of constipation in the forlax and lactulose groups was 70% and 40% respectively (P < 0.05) by week 1 of treatment, and that was 72% and 41% respectively (P < 0.05) by week 2 of treatment. Abdominal pain disappeared in 75% of patients in the forlax group but in only 57% in the lactulose group by week 2 of treatment (P < 0.05). No serious adverse events happened and no abnormalities were found in laboratory tests and physical examinations in the two groups after medication. Forlax is safe and effective in the treatment of constipation in children over 8 years old. [PMID: 17937851, Bao-Xi Wang et al., 2007] Pranlukast (PLK) is a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) that has been approved for treatment of asthma in patients of all ages and allergic rhinitis (AR) in adults but not for AR in children in Japan. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study used an artificial  exposure chamber (OHIO Chamber) to investigate the efficacy and safety of PLK in children from 10 to 15 years old with seasonal AR (SAR) due to Japanese cedar (JC) pollen. Eighty-four subjects were enrolled and randomized to the treatment arm and 74 were included in the per protocol set. Subjects  received either PLK dry syrup (DS) or placebo for 1 week. They were challenged with JC pollen in the OHIO Chamber for 3 hours. Total nasal symptom scores (TNSSs) were recorded every 30 minutes during the exposure. PLK DS treatment suppressed the TNSS changes from baseline significantly when  compared with placebo. The difference in the least square means in TNSS between the PLK DS-treated group and placebo group was -0.37 (95% CI, -0.54, -0.20) with a value of p < 0.0001, showing that PLK DS significantly suppressed the nasal symptoms. Regarding specific  nasal symptoms, PLK DS significantly suppressed sneezing, nasal discharge, and nasal obstruction. The effect of PLK DS on nasal obstruction was most prominent, with significant improvement relative to placebo beginning 60 minutes after the start of exposure. No serious adverse events were  reported during the study. In this study, PLK DS is effective and safe for treatment in children with SAR. [PMID: 22370535, Ken-ichiro Wakabayashi et al., ] Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome is the most common glomerular disease in children, but there are still some difficulties in treating childhood steroid-dependent or steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SDNS/SRNS). Rituximab (RTX) might be an effective and safe choice. Studies were searched from PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane library and some Chinese databases up to April 2020. Only randomized controlled trials (RCT) were included. Of 1383 screened articles, 6 RCTs with 334 participants were included. RTX was better than the control group at improving relapse-free rate in the short term [RR (risk ratio) (95% CI (confidence interval)), 1.84(1.41, 2.39)]. As for long-term, RTX did not show significant improvement [RR (95% CI), 4.43(.57, 34.67)]; but in subgroup analysis, RTX was still better than conventional drugs and tacrolimus [RR (95% CI), 9.91(1.95, 50.52) and 1.42(1.15, 1.75), respectively]. And there was a difference between the two groups of prednisolone dose after treatment [MD (mean difference) (95% CI), -.22(-.36, -.09) mg/kg/d)]. However, RTX did not significantly improve serum albumin and creatinine [MD (95% CI), 3.46(-1.40, 8.32)g/L and -3.66(-11.79, 4.48)μmol/L, respectively]. No significant differences between the RTX and the control group were found in total adverse events (AEs) or serious AEs. Childhood SDNS/SRNS patients appear to benefit from RTX in relapse-free rate and dose of prednisolone use. Also, RTX did not significantly increase the incidence of AEs. But RTX did not show improvements in biological indicators, more studies are required to explain the effect of RTX. [PMID: 33070945, Dan Chang et al., 2021] Rilonacept (Araclyst) has been approved to treat recurrent pericarditis and to reduce the risk of recurrence in adults and children 12 years of age and older. The drug is given subcutaneously. [PMID: 34156376, Diane S Aschenbrenner et al., 2021] The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG 4000) for the treatment of constipation in children over 8 years of age. A total of 216 children from 7 hospitals were enrolled. A total of 105 patients received oral PEG 4000 (20 g/day) and 111 patients received oral lactulose (15 ml/day) for 2 weeks. The stool frequency, stool consistency and abdominal pain of the patients were monitored. In the PEG group, following one week and two weeks of treatment, the median weekly stool frequency improved from 2 times prior to treatment to 6 and 7 times, respectively, following treatment. The clinical remission rates of the PEG and lactulose groups following one week of treatment were 70.48 and 39.64%, respectively, and following two weeks of treatment were 72.38 and 41.44%, respectively. Abdominal pain disappeared in 74.6% of patients following two weeks of PEG 4000 treatment. No significant clinical adverse effects or abnormalities in the laboratory tests were observed in the two treatment groups. In conclusion, PEG 4000 is a safe and more effective drug compared to lactulose for the treatment of constipation in children. [PMID: 22969980, Yishi Wang et al., 2012] Although second-generation antihistamines, such as bepotastine besilate, are recommended as a first-line treatment option for adult perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR), few non-sedating second-generation antihistamines are safe for children. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, comparative study of 473 pediatric PAR patients (7 - 15 years old) to determine the superiority and safety of bepotastine besilate (10 mg twice daily) relative to placebo for improved total and individual nasal symptom scores compared with baseline. Subjects were randomized to placebo (n = 233) or bepotastine besilate (n = 240, 10 mg orally twice daily for 2 weeks). Interference of daily life by PAR was assessed by measuring change in individual nasal symptom scores from baseline. Bepotastine besilate was superior to placebo in terms of total nasal symptom scores, with improved overall nasal symptoms of PAR compared with baseline values. Subgroup analyses demonstrated bepotastine besilate was effective irrespective of age, sex or body weight. No clinically significant adverse drug reactions often observed with first-generation antihistamines were reported and no difference in adverse events between groups was observed. Bepotastine besilate is effective and safe for pediatric PAR patients aged 7 - 15 years, and has a significant clinical impact on PAR. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01861522 ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01861522 ). [PMID: 26364765, Kimihiro Okubo et al., 2015] This study analyzes the efficacy and safety of a retrievable, fully covered self-expanding metal stent (cSEMS) in the treatment of refractory benign esophageal restenosis in children. This is a retrospective analysis of the application of a newly designed cSEMS in treating refractory benign postoperative restenosis in five children with ages ranging from 16 months to 8 years. Efficacy and safety were evaluated during the follow-up period. cSEMS with or without an antireflux valve at the distal end were successfully placed and removed in five children. These five patients were followed up for 4-12 months after stent removal. Among the five patients, ulcerative stricture was observed in two patients because of reflux esophagitis, while three patients showed no signs of stricture recurrence. Stent migration was observed in three patients, two of which required the stent to be reset. The narrow esophagus was successfully expended to a diameter of 12-13 mm. Besides the observation of mild granulation tissue growth in one case, no severe complications were observed during surgery and after stent placement. Our study suggests that a retrievable, fully covered SEMS is safe and partially effective for treating refractory benign postoperative esophageal restenosis in children during short-term observation. [PMID: 24210192, Jie Zhang et al., 2013] The present study aimed at verifying the safety and efficacy of rifampicin in ameliorating pruritus in cholestatic children. Twenty-three Egyptian children (14 boys and 9 girls), suffering from intractable pruritus of cholestasis, were included. Rifampicin was started at a dose of 10 mg/Kg/day in two divided doses and increased gradually to a maximum of 20 mg/Kg/day if there was no response. Liver function tests were followed up weekly. Seventeen patients (74%) showed improvement of pruritus with rifampicin. None of the patients showed any deterioration in liver functions. Rifampicin in a dose of 10-20 mg/Kg/day is safe and effective in ameliorating uncontrollable pruritus in children with persistent cholestasis. [PMID: 17401268, Hanaa El-Karaksy et al., 2007] Infections with viruses causing upper respiratory tract infection (URI) are associated with increased leukotriene levels in the upper airways. Montelukast, a selective leukotriene-receptor antagonist, is an effective treatment of asthma and allergic rhinitis. To determine whether prophylactic treatment with montelukast reduces the incidence and severity of URI in children. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed in 3 primary care pediatric ambulatory clinics in Israel. Healthy children aged 1 to 5 years were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 12-week treatment with 4 mg oral montelukast or look-alike placebo. Patients were excluded if they had a previous history of reactive airway disease. A study coordinator contacted the parents by phone once a week to obtain information regarding the occurrence of acute respiratory episodes. The parents received a diary card to record any acute symptoms of URI. The primary outcome measure was the number of URI episodes. Three hundred children were recruited and randomly assigned into montelukast (n = 153) or placebo (n = 147) groups. One hundred thirty-one (85.6%) of the children treated with montelukast and 129 (87.7%) of the children treated with placebo completed 12 weeks of treatment. The number of weeks in which URI was reported was 30.4% in children treated with montelukast and 30.7% in children treated with placebo. There was no significant difference in any of the secondary variables between the groups. In preschool-aged children, 12-week treatment with montelukast, compared with placebo, did not reduce the incidence of URI. [PMID: 22218843, Eran Kozer et al., 2012] Ceftriaxone is widely used in children in the treatment of sepsis. However, concerns have been raised about the safety of ceftriaxone, especially in young children. The aim of this review is to systematically evaluate the safety of ceftriaxone in children of all age groups. MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, CINAHL, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts and adverse drug reaction (ADR) monitoring systems will be systematically searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, case-control studies, cross-sectional studies, case series and case reports evaluating the safety of ceftriaxone in children. The Cochrane risk of bias tool, Newcastle-Ottawa and quality assessment tools developed by the National Institutes of Health will be used for quality assessment. Meta-analysis of the incidence of ADRs from RCTs and prospective studies will be done. Subgroup analyses will be performed for age and dosage regimen. Formal ethical approval is not required as no primary data are collected. This systematic review will be disseminated through a peer-reviewed publication and at conference meetings. CRD42017055428. [PMID: 28827252, Linan Zeng et al., 2017] Montelukast (MT) is a leukotriene D4 antagonist. It is an effective and safe medicine for the prophylaxis and treatment of chronic asthma. It is also used to prevent acute exercise-induced bronchoconstriction and as a symptomatic relief of seasonal allergic rhinitis and perennial allergic rhinitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the bioequivalence (BE) of two drug products: generic MT 5 mg chewable tablets versus the branded drug Singulair(®) pediatric 5 mg chewable tablets among Mediterranean volunteers. An open-label, randomized two-period crossover BE design was conducted in 32 healthy male volunteers with a 9-day washout period between doses and under fasting conditions. The drug concentrations in plasma were quantified by using a newly developed and fully validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method, and the pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using a non-compartmental model. The ratio for generic/branded tablets using geometric least squares means was calculated for both the MT products. The relationship between concentration and peak area ratio was found to be linear within the range 6.098-365.855 ng/mL. The correlation coefficient (R (2)) was always greater than 0.99 during the course of the validation. Statistical comparison of the main pharmacokinetic parameters showed no significant difference between the generic and branded products. The point estimates (ratios of geometric means) were 101.2%, 101.6%, and 98.11% for area under the curve (AUC)0→last, AUC0→inf, and C max, respectively. The 90% confidence intervals were within the predefined limits of 80.00%-125.00% as specified by the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency for BE studies. Broncast(®) pediatric chewable tablets (5 mg/tablet) are bioequivalent to Singulair(®) pediatric chewable tablets (5 mg/tablet), with a similar safety profile. This suggests that these two formulations can be considered interchangeable in clinical practice. [PMID: 26451086, Abdel Naser Zaid et al., 2015] Sugammadex reverses neuromuscular blockade by chemical encapsulation of rocuronium. This phase IIIA study explored efficacy and safety of sugammadex in infants (28 days to 23 months), children (2-11 yr), adolescents (12-17 yr), and adults (18-65 yr). Anesthetized patients (American Society of Anesthesiologists class 1-2) received 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium and were randomized to receive sugammadex (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, or 4.0 mg/kg) or placebo at reappearance of T2. Neuromuscular monitoring was performed using acceleromyography. Primary endpoint was time from sugammadex/placebo administration to recovery of the train-of-four ratio to 0.9. Adverse events and electrocardiograms were recorded, and blood samples were collected for safety and determination of sugammadex and rocuronium plasma concentrations. A dose-response relation was demonstrated in children (n = 22), adolescents (n = 28), and adults (n = 26), but not infants because of the small sample size (n = 8). After placebo, median recovery time of train-of-four to 0.9 was 21.0, 19.0, 23.4, and 28.5 min in infants, children, adolescents, and adults, respectively. After 2.0 mg/kg sugammadex train-of-four 0.9 was attained in 0.6, 1.2, 1.1, and 1.2 min, respectively. The sugammadex plasma concentrations were similar for the children, adolescent, and adult age groups across the dose range. Sugammadex was well tolerated: No reoccurrence of blockade, inadequate reversal, significant QT prolongation, or other abnormalities were observed. Sugammadex is a new reversal agent that rapidly, effectively, safely, and with similar recovery times reverses rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade in children, adolescents, adults, and the small number of infants studied. [PMID: 19194156, Benoît Plaud et al., 2009] (1) Respiratory distress and seizures developed in an 18-month-old boy following brief exposure to low-strength (17.6%) N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET). A review of the literature revealed 17 reports of DEET-induced encephalopathy in children. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that the potential toxicity of DEET is high and that available repellents containing DEET, irrespective of their strength, are not safe when applied to children's skin. (2) Although this is a case report, we used the features of published reports of DEET-induced encephalopathy in children to support the diagnosis, since the evidence that the child's illness was caused by DEET was circumstantial. In the following case analysis, clinical reports of children < 16 years old have been reviewed and analyzed in an effort to relate direct DEET toxicity to various clinical, demographic, and toxic compound exposure factors (Fisher's exacttest and logistic regression analysis). (3) DEET-induced encephalopathy in children (56% girls) followed not only ingestion or repeated and extensive application of repellents, but also a brief exposure to DEET (45%). Of those who reported a dermal exposure, 33% reported an exposure to a product containing DEET < 20%. Seizures, the most prominent symptom (72%), were significantly more frequent when DEET solutions were applied to the skin (P<0.01). Mortality (16.6%) did not correlate significantly with the concentration of the DEET liquid used, duration of skin exposure, pattern of use, age, or sex. (4) Data of this case analysis suggest that repellents containing DEET are not safe when applied to children's skin and should be avoided in children. Additionally, since the potential toxicity of DEET is high, less toxic preparations should be probably substituted for DEET-containing repellents, whenever possible. [PMID: 11339626, G Briassoulis et al., 2001] To study the efficacy and safety of repeated application of rituximab (RTX) at a low dose (200 mg/m A randomized controlled trial was conducted for 29 children with FRNS/SDNS who received systemic treatment in the Department of Nephrology, Anhui Provincial Children's Hospital, from September 2020 to December 2021. These children were divided into a recommended dose group ( After RTX treatment, both the low dose group and the recommended dose group achieved B-lymphocyte depletion and had significant reductions in the number of relapses and glucocorticoid dose ( Repeated RTX treatment at a low dose has comparable clinical efficacy and safety to that at the recommended dose and can significantly reduce the number of FRNS/SDNS relapses and the amount of glucocorticoids used, with little adverse effect throughout the treatment cycle. Therefore, it holds promise for clinical application. [PMID: 37382130, Ying Zhu et al., 2023]
