Venlafaxine is commonly used in the United States for approved and non-Food and Drug Administration-approved indications in adults. It is used off-label to treat children for psychiatric diagnoses. The aim of the study was to describe venlafaxine toxicities in children and to identify the venlafaxine dose per weight that correlates with toxicities. An 11-year retrospective study of venlafaxine ingestion in children was performed using the California Poison Control System (CPCS) database. Data was extracted from phone calls received by CPCS clinicians and follow-up phone calls made to assess the patient's progress in a health-care setting. Inclusion criteria were venlafaxine ingestion cases reported to CPCS between January 2001 and December 2011, children aged 20 years and under, venlafaxine as the only ingested substance, managed in a health-care facility, and followed to a known outcome. Two hundred sixty-two cases met the study criteria. Common presentations included gastrointestinal (14.9%), altered mental status (13.7%), and tachycardia (13.4%). The majority of the cases resulted in no effect (51.5%) or minor effect (19.9%). The average estimated dose per weight was 18.3 mg/kg in all patients and 64.5 mg/kg in those experiencing moderate-to-severe adverse effects. Seizures occurred in only 4 of the 262 cases at doses ranging from 1500 to 7500 mg. Although the estimated dose per weight exceeded 10 mg/kg for the majority of the cases, only 12 cases resulted in moderate or severe outcomes. The majority of venlafaxine ingestion cases in children resulted in either no clinical effects or minor clinical effects.  [PMID: 26351291, S Doroudgar et al., 2016] The tolerability and safety of venlafaxine hydrochloride, a new serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, are reviewed in this article. The data presented here are based on a pool of 3,082 patients who were treated with this agent during clinical trials. Of these patients, 2,897 received venlafaxine for depression; 455 of these patients were treated for more than 360 days. The tolerability and safety profiles of venlafaxine were similar to those previously reported for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Patients receiving venlafaxine experienced nausea, insomnia, dizziness, somnolence, constipation, and sweating more often than did patients receiving placebo but reported anticholinergic events less frequently than did patients receiving tricyclics. This is accounted for by the fact that, unlike the tricyclics, venlafaxine lacks significant affinity for muscarinic cholinergic receptors. Resolution of venlafaxine-associated nausea occurred rapidly in the vast majority of the patients who reported it at the start of therapy. Serious adverse events were rare among venlafaxine-treated patients. A small percentage of the patients given venlafaxine experienced modest but significant increases in blood-pressure readings, similar to those observed among imipramine-treated patients. At mean daily venlafaxine dosages of up to 300 mg, the percentage of venlafaxine-treated patients who had sustained elevations in supine diastolic blood pressure during treatment ranged from 2% to 6%, compared with 2% and 5% among the placebo- and imipramine-treated patients, respectively. All of the 14 patients who took an overdose of venlafaxine recovered without sequelae. Tolerability and safety in the elderly did not differ significantly from that observed in younger patients. [PMID: 8784648, R L Rudolph et al., 1996] The primary purpose of this study was to describe tolerability and efficacy of venlafaxine in the treatment of children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A 6-week open trial of venlafaxine was conducted in 13 children and adolescents (mean age 9.9 +/- 2.5 years) with ADHD, and without comorbid depression. Venlafaxine was initiated at a dose of 18.75 mg/day and flexibly titrated to 56.25 mg/day. The Conners parent scale and Clinical Global Improvement (CGI) severity item were performed at baseline and at the end of the 6-week trial. All subjects completed the trial. Mean final dose of venlafaxine was 40.3 +/- 7.0. Venlafaxine was significantly effective in reducing the total score of the Conners parent scale from baseline to endpoint (P < 0.002, Z =-3.113) and the CGI severity item (P < 0.05). Transient side-effects such as somnolence (n = 2), stomachache (n = 2), and headache (n = 1) disappeared after second week of treatment. Also three subjects complained of sedation after raising the dose to 56.5 mg/day, therefore the dose was reduced to the previous level. These preliminary data suggest that venlafaxine may be an effective medication in the treatment of some children and adolescents with ADHD. Future double-blind controlled trials should be undertaken. [PMID: 14678464, Nahit Motavalli Mukaddes et al., 2004] Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common psychiatric disorder in children and adolescents. Stimulants are commonly prescribed for ADHD management. There is clinical trial evidence that some medications with noradrenergic properties such as atomoxetine are effective. It is of theoretical and practical importance if other agents with noradrenergic properties display a comparable pattern of efficacy. This paper is a systematic review of the efficacy and safety of venlafaxine for treating children and adolescents with ADHD. MEDLINE, Google scholar, Scopus, and Web of science (ISI) databases were electronically searched in July 2012, updated on November 2012. Time and language of publication were not exclusion criteria. Efficacy outcomes were assessed by a valid and reliable parent- and/or teacher-reported instrument to evaluate clinical symptoms. Adverse effects were also evaluated. There were three uncontrolled trials and only two double blind controlled clinical trials. Venlafaxine appeared effective for treating ADHD. The rates of some adverse effects of venlafaxine were less than those documented for methylphenidate. While one of the two small controlled trials did not find difference between venlafaxine ad methylphenidate, the other trial reported lower efficacy for venlafaxine. Headache, insomnia, and nausea were among the most common adverse effects. This systematic review provides preliminary support that venlafaxine may have short term utility in treating ADHD in children and adolescents. However, before recommending venlafaxine for treatment, more robust and larger clinical trials, in particular providing evidence of its long-term efficacy, safety and tolerability are required. [PMID: 23157376, Ahmad Ghanizadeh et al., 2013] A 5-week open trial of venlafaxine was conducted in 16 children and adolescents (mean age 11.6 years) with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in order to estimate the appropriate dosage range and to determine the extent of side effects. Subjects were evaluated using a structured clinical interview and a computerized diagnostic assessment, and subjects diagnosed with ADHD and without comorbid depression were asked to enter the study. Conners Parent Rating Scale (CPRS) and Conners Continuous Performance Test (CPT) were performed at baseline and at the end of the 5-week trial. Two subjects were lost to follow-up. Of the remaining 14 patients, 7 subjects displayed a decrease of at least one standard deviation from their baseline on one of the CPRS subscale scores and had subjective reports from parents of improved behavior. There were no statistically significant effects of venlafaxine on reaction times or on the number of commission and omission errors on CPT. Three ADHD subjects displayed a worsening of their hyperactivity and required discontinuation of venlafaxine, and nausea led to drug discontinuation in 1 patient. The mean daily dose of venlafaxine was 60 mg (1.4 mg/kg), administered 2-3 divided doses, there were no effects on blood pressure or heart rate. In this sample, low doses of venlafaxine appeared to be effective in reducing behavioral but not cognitive symptoms of ADHD in 7 of 16 children and adolescents (44%), and adverse effects were not tolerable in 4 of 16 patients (25%). These preliminary results suggest that venlafaxine may aggravate symptoms of hyperactivity, consistent with the behavioral activation reported with fluoxetine and sertraline in children. [PMID: 9231317, R L Olvera et al., 1996] Major depression is commonly found in the child and adolescent population. Venlafaxine, a new antidepressant, has been used successfully in adults; however, its use in children and adolescents has been very limited. This study evaluated the efficacy and side effect profile of venlafaxine in the treatment of depression in children and adolescents. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6-week study, 33 subjects between the ages of 8 and 17, who met DSM-IV criteria for major depression, were treated with either venlafaxine and therapy or placebo and therapy. Patient progress data were obtained by weekly rating assessments. Data on side effects were also obtained weekly. The statistical analysis indicated a significant improvement over time, but it could not be attributed to venlafaxine drug therapy. These findings are consistent with other studies where the efficacy of antidepressants in the treatment of major depression in this age population remains unproven. Low dosage and short length of treatment may account for the lack of efficacy. The findings did, however, suggest a low side-effect profile. Further studies are recommended to assess efficacy and to corroborate its safety in children and adolescents. [PMID: 9133767, M W Mandoki et al., 1997] Vilazodone hydrochloride is the first member in a new class of antidepressants called indolealkylamines and was approved for use in the United States in 2011 for major depressive disorder. It has a combined mechanism of action of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a partial agonist of serotonin 5-HT1A receptors. It has not been approved for use in the pediatric population, and toxicity from exploratory vilazodone ingestion has been rarely described to date. We describe 2 children with laboratory-confirmed vilazodone ingestions that led to significant toxicity including refractory status epilepticus in 1 patient and likely transient seizure activity in the other. Both patients required multiple doses of benzodiazepines; in the more severe case, barbiturates were added to control seizure activity. These children returned to baseline and had no prolonged neurologic complications. Pediatric experience with vilazodone is limited; however, the literature demonstrates 3 additional case reports of children experiencing seizure after vilazodone ingestion. With the 2 new cases presented here, it seems prudent to educate prescribers and families of the potential dangers of ingestion of vilazodone tablets by young children. [PMID: 28590988, Jeannine Del Pizzo et al., 2018] The objectives of this pilot study were to explore the changes in symptom severity, tolerability, and the pharmacodynamics of venlafaxine treatment in youths with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This was a 2-week, open-label, outpatient trial of venlafaxine in children and adolescents, ages 5-17 years, with ADHD. Three dosing strata, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/kg per day, were examined. ADHD symptom severity and improvement assessments included the ADHD Rating Scale (ARS-IV) and the Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI). During this study, venlafaxine, O-desmethylvenlafaxine (ODV), norepinephrine, and serotonin concentrations were obtained. Thirty-eight participants (33 males) were treated in this trial. Overall, parent-completed and teacher-completed ARS-IV total scores showed a statistically significant positive change at the end of the study when compared to baseline (p < 0.05). Significant increases in plasma venlafaxine concentrations were observed at day 15 when compared to day 8 (p = 0.04). In addition, plasma norepinephrine and serotonin concentrations were found to be significantly decreased from baseline at end of study (p < 0.05). Four patients ended participation in the study prematurely: lost to follow up (n = 2), withdrawal of consent (n = 1), and worsening of ADHD symptoms after 8 days of treatment (n = 1). There were no discontinuations due to other adverse events. Venlafaxine appeared to offer some benefit and appears to be relatively safe for the short-term treatment of ADHD in this open-label trial. The pharmacodynamics of venlafaxine in youths are consistent with serotonergic and neuradrenergic modulation. [PMID: 17822339, Robert L Findling et al., 2007] Venlafaxine (VEN) is a second generation antidepressant drug, belonging to the class of selective serotonine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, widely used in the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders. Though its pharmacological profile is considered safe, treatment with VEN can cause several nervous, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular and genitourinary adverse effects. Therapeutic drug monitoring for VEN could be useful in specific situations, including exposure to the drug during pregnancy. A liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry method was developed and validated for the assay of VEN in 2.5-mg hair samples from 2 newborn identical twin sisters. The analyte was extracted by a rapid, simultaneous pulverization and extraction step, allowing analysis when tiny amounts of hair are available, such as in the case of a newborn. Gradient elution on an Atlantis T3 column was performed using nordiazepam-d5 as an internal standard. Positive ion electrospray ionization and high-resolution full scan determination were performed in an Orbitrap mass spectrometer. The method was linear range in the range 0.2-25 ng/mg, and had a quantification limit of 0.2 ng/mg, a relative standard deviation in the range 0.7%-1.4% (intra-assay) and 2.9%-5.9% (interassay), and was accurate (as % relative error) in the range -9% to + 2%, using a hair sample size as low as 2.5 mg. The utilization of high-resolution/high accuracy mass spectrometry in full-scan mode allowed both the quantitative determination of VEN in the hair of the 2 newborns and the straightforward identification of 4 VEN metabolites, namely O-desmethylvenlafaxine, N-desmethylvenlafaxine, N,N-didesmethylvenlafaxine, and N,O-didesmethylvenlafaxine, by means of retrospective screening, thus unequivocally documenting in utero exposure. [PMID: 19855313, Donata Favretto et al., 2010] To review the current literature on the efficacy and safety of serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors in the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the pediatric population. A literature search from 1996 to August 2013 was conducted using MEDLINE, CINAHL, and EMBASE databases. Search terms included attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, pediatric attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, venlafaxine, duloxetine, desvenlafaxine, milnacipran, and nefazodone. Relevant articles on duloxetine and venlafaxine for the treatment of pediatric ADHD were reviewed; 5 studies on venlafaxine and 1 study on duloxetine were evaluated. Studies included open-label and randomized, double-blind trials. Case studies in pediatric populations and all studies in adult populations were excluded. Patients 6 to 17 years old were evaluated in the venlafaxine and duloxetine studies. Trials on venlafaxine, ranging from 2 to 6 weeks, showed patient improvement as measured by the Conners Rating Scale and ADHD Rating Scale. Venlafaxine was initiated at 12.5 to 25 mg/d and titrated up to 1.4 to 3.8 mg/kg/d to a maximum of 150 mg/d. Duloxetine showed minimal efficacy in treating ADHD symptoms at doses of 60 mg/d at 6 weeks. The most common side effects for venlafaxine and duloxetine included drowsiness and decreased appetite, respectively. Data for venlafaxine and duloxetine are limited. However, venlafaxine may be considered as an alternative agent when patients cannot tolerate or fail stimulants, tricyclic antidepressants, or bupropion. Duloxetine has been studied in children; however, with only 1 study available, it is difficult to recommend. [PMID: 24259607, Pauline Park et al., 2014] Venlafaxine hydrochloride is a novel bicyclic antidepressant which inhibits the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine and, to a lesser extent, dopamine. A 41-year-old female ingested 4.5 g venlafaxine, 500 mg diphenhydramine, 50 mg thiothixene and subsequently experienced severe central nervous system depression requiring intubation. She also developed elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressures and sinus tachycardia. The patient was decontaminated with gastric lavage and activated charcoal. She regained consciousness within a few hours and was extubated nine hours after ingestion. This case demonstrates that severe central nervous system depression may follow venlafaxine overdose. [PMID: 7629904, A Fantaskey et al., 1995] Narcolepsy with cataplexy is rare in children under 5 years of age. There is limited information on safe and effective treatment of cataplexy in young children. We describe successful treatment of cataplexy in a 3-year-old using venlafaxine and subsequently followed for over 2 years. [PMID: 24340297, Michelle Ratkiewicz et al., 2013] The present report aimed to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of venlafaxine compared to methylphenidate in children and adolescents with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). This was a 6-week, parallel group, randomized clinical trial. Thirty-eight patients (27 boys and 11 girls) with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of ADHD were the study population of this trial. All study subjects were randomly assigned to receive treatment using capsules of venlafaxine at doses of 50-75 mg/day depending on weight (50 mg/day for <30 kg and 75 mg/day for >30 kg (group 1) or methylphenidate at a dose of 20-30 mg/day depending on weight (group 2) for a 6-week double blind, randomized clinical trial. The principal measure of outcome was the Teacher and Parent Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale-IV. No significant differences were observed between the two groups on the Parent and Teacher Rating Scale scores (df = 1; F = 1.77; p = 0.19 and df = 1; F = 1.64; p = 0.20, respectively). Side effects of headaches and insomnia were observed more frequently in the methylphenidate group. The results suggest that venlafaxine may be useful for the treatment of ADHD. In addition, a tolerable side-effect profile is one of the advantages of venlafaxine in the treatment of ADHD. [PMID: 20860068, Ali-Reza Zarinara et al., 2010] Venlafaxine (VEN), a serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor is being used as a drug of choice for treating clinical depression even during pregnancy. It is an important therapeutic option in the treatment of perinatal depression, but the effects of VEN on fetus and the newborn are uncertain. Therefore, present study was undertaken to investigate the safety of in-utero exposure to VEN in terms of developmental neurotoxicity and neurodegenerative potential by using prenatal rat model. The selected doses of VEN (25, 40 and 50mg/kg) were administered to pregnant rats from GD 5 to 19 through oral gavage. The fetal brains were dissected and processed for histopathological measurements of neocortical thickness that showed significant reduction. Considering vulnerability of immature brain to free radical injury, VEN exposed neocortices were tested for reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels which were significantly increased. As ROS play important role in the initiation of apoptotic mechanisms, we explored for in situ detection of apoptosis by confocal microscopy that showed enhanced apoptosis including chromatin condensation which was further reconfirmed by electron microscopy. Substantially increased levels of pro-apoptotic protein Bax and decreased levels of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2 as shown by western blotting also supported the increased neuro-apoptotic degeneration. For further correlation of these findings, prenatally VEN exposed young-adult rat offspring were assessed for open field exploratory behavior that showed increased anxiety-like and stereotypic responses indicating disturbed neurobehavioral pattern. The study concludes that prenatal VEN exposure may primarily enhance ROS generation that plays a key role in regulating release of proapoptotic factors from mitochondria and thereby enhancing apoptotic neurodegeneration that affect proliferation, migration and differentiation of cells, resulting in neuronal deficits manifested as long term neurobehavioral impairments.  [PMID: 25450524, Manish Singh et al., 2015] Venlafaxine hydrochloride, a structurally novel antidepressant, is also the first nontricyclic serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. Although venlafaxine has an overall side effect and safety profile that is comparable to other newer antidepressants, it can cause both transient and sustained elevations of supine diastolic blood pressure (SDBP), probably the result of noradrenergic potentiation. Presented here is a meta-analysis of original data on blood pressure, using both random effects and a multivariate survival analyses. The sample consisted of 3744 patients with major depression who were studied in controlled clinical trials comparing venlafaxine with imipramine and/or placebo. Patients were treated for 6 weeks of acute phase therapy; some responders received up to 1 year of continuation phase therapy. Venlafaxine and imipramine were associated with small, but statistically significant, increases in SDBP during acute phase therapy. When compared with imipramine and placebo, venlafaxine was also associated with a greater proportion of persistent elevations of SDBP during continuation therapy. The effect of venlafaxine was highly dose dependent, and the incidence of elevated SDBP was statistically and clinically significant only at dosages above 300 mg/day. Venlafaxine did not adversely affect the control of blood pressure for patients with preexisting high blood pressure or elevated baseline values. Venlafaxine has a dose-dependent effect on SDBP that is clinically significant at high dosages. Concern about blood pressure effects should not deter first-line use of this effective antidepressant, although more extensive studies of patients with cardiovascular diseases are still necessary. [PMID: 9818630, M E Thase et al., 1998] The potential genotoxic effect of venlafaxine hydrochloride (venlafaxine), an antidepressant drug-active ingredient, was investigated by using  [PMID: 30025480, Selim Ayabaktı et al., 2020] Venlafaxine is an antidepressant which acts through the inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin. Venlafaxine is active against neuropathic and chronic pain. We report the case of a 69-year-old woman who presented a paclitaxel-induced neuropathy. She presented paresthesias, pin pricks in both hands with functional impairment. Venlafaxine hydrochloride was introduced at 37.5 mg twice daily. The patient noticed a dramatic recovery of her symptoms within 2 days, with both reduction of the paresthesias and functional improvement. This is the first report of efficacious use of venlafaxine for the treatment of paclitaxel cumulative neurosensory toxicity. [PMID: 12187335, Jean-Philippe Durand et al., 2002] We examined the efficacy and safety of three different dosages of venlafaxine hydrochloride (75, 225, and 375 mg/day) in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, four-group study. Outpatients, 18 to 65 years old, who met DSM-III criteria for major depression were included (N = 358 randomized; 194 completed). Of the total patients completing the trial, 59%, 56%, 51%, and 51% were in the placebo, 75-mg, 225-mg, and 375-mg groups, respectively. The primary outcome measures were the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D21) total, HAM-D21 depression item, Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale total, and Clinical Global Impressions scale. Each dosage of venlafaxine was associated with statistically significant improvement as compared with placebo, based on the intent-to-treat sample. The two higher dosages were associated with a modestly greater antidepressant response than was the 75-mg dosage. Nausea, dizziness, somnolence, and anorexia were the most common adverse events attributable to venlafaxine. Since headache occurred at a similar frequency in both the drug and placebo groups, we did not consider it to be attributable to venlafaxine use. Withdrawal from the study due to adverse events occurred in 5%, 17%, 24%, and 30% of the patients in the placebo, 75-mg, 225-mg, and 375-mg groups, respectively. Venlafaxine, at dosages of 75-375 mg/day, is an effective and well-tolerated antidepressant. With increasing dosage, greater efficacy and possibly more adverse effects will occur. [PMID: 9541154, R L Rudolph et al., 1998] Fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, have not been recommended for use in children largely because studies in juvenile laboratory animals suggest there may be an increased risk of fluoroquinolone-associated cartilage lesions. A large prospective trial is needed to assess the risks associated with using levofloxacin in children. Assess the safety and tolerability of levofloxacin therapy in children based on observations for 1 year after therapy. Safety data were collected in children who participated in 1 of 3 efficacy trials (N = 2523) and a subset of these children who also subsequently participated in a long-term 1-year surveillance trial (N = 2233). Incidence of adverse events in children randomized to receive levofloxacin versus nonfluoroquinolone antibiotics was compared. Based on assessments by treating physicians and an independent data safety monitoring committee, events related to the musculoskeletal system were further categorized as 1 of 4 predefined musculoskeletal disorders (arthralgia, arthritis, tendinopathy, gait abnormality) considered most likely clinical correlates of fluoroquinolone-associated cartilage lesions observed in laboratory animals. Levofloxacin was well tolerated during and for 1 month after therapy as evidenced by similar incidence and character of adverse events compared with nonfluoroquinolone antibiotics. However, incidence of at least 1 of the 4 predefined musculoskeletal disorders (largely due to reports of arthralgia) was greater in levofloxacin-treated compared with nonfluoroquinolone-treated children at 2 months (2.1% vs. 0.9%; P = 0.04) and 12 months (3.4% vs. 1.8%; P = 0.03) after starting therapy. The incidence of 1 or more of the 4 predefined musculoskeletal disorders identified in nonblinded, prospective evaluations, was statistically greater in levofloxacin-treated compared with comparator-treated children. [PMID: 17901792, Gary J Noel et al., 2007] The safety of fexofenadine has been examined extensively in adults and school-age children. However, the safety of fexofenadine in children younger than 6 years has not been reported to date. To compare the safety and tolerability of twice-daily fexofenadine hydrochloride, 30 mg, and placebo in preschool children aged 2 to 5 years with allergic rhinitis. This was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, conducted between February 29, 2000, and June 14, 2001. Participants were randomized to either fexofenadine hydrochloride, 30 mg, or placebo twice daily for a 2-week period. To facilitate dosing, capsule content was mixed with applesauce (approximately 10 mL). Safety assessments depended on date of entry into the study because of an amendment to the protocol. Before the amendment, assessments included physical examination, vital signs reporting (oral temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate), and adverse event (AE) reporting. After the amendment, safety assessments included laboratory testing (blood chemistry and hematology profiles), physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiography, and vital signs (oral temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate) and AE reporting. Treatment-emergent AEs were observed in 116 of 231 participants receiving placebo and 111 of 222 receiving fexofenadine. These AEs were possibly related to study medication in 19 (8.2%) and 21 (9.5%) of the participants receiving placebo and fexofenadine, respectively, and most frequently involved the digestive system. No clinically relevant differences in laboratory measures, vital signs, and physical examinations were observed. The findings show that fexofenadine hydrochloride, 30 mg, is well tolerated and has a good safety profile in children aged 2 to 5 years with allergic rhinitis. [PMID: 17941284, Henry Milgrom et al., 2007] Venlafaxine representing a new class of antidepressants is a potent serotonin/ norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. Transdermal delivery of venlafaxine hydrochloride (VHCl) may result in proper patient compliance by reducing the incidence of the undesirable GI problems generally associated with its plural oral dosing. The present study is an attempt to investigate the improvement of the transdermal flux of the hydrophilic VHCl by certain permeation enhancers viz. glycerin, urea, propylene glycol and mixture of propylene glycol and ethanol across pig ear skin. The cumulative drug release was the highest from the formulation F5 consisting of the mixture of propylene glycol and ethanol in sodium alginate gel with a load of 25% w/w VHCl with 96% permeation enhancement. The steady state flux observed with F5 was 0.203 mg cm(-2) hr and an area of 15.27 cm(2) would suffice to arrive at a required therapeutic concentration of VHCl in the blood. [PMID: 22707834, C Vijaya et al., 2011] Venlafaxine (Efexor), a selective noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor, is an important therapeutic option in the treatment of perinatal depression, but its effects on the newborn are uncertain. We present a report of two infants with neonatal seizures attributed to maternal use of venlafaxine. The first infant was hypotonic and required resuscitation at birth. The second was born in a good condition but developed clinically apparent seizures after the second day of life. Both infants responded rapidly to treatment with phenobarbitone that was weaned uneventfully by the first and second week of life. Both remain well at 1 year of age. Other causes of neonatal seizures were excluded and neurological investigations on these two infants were unremarkable. We suggest that all infants exposed to maternal venlafaxine, no matter their condition at birth, be monitored in hospital for at least 3 to 4 days in order to preempt and treat adverse neurological events. [PMID: 17044905, Ravi K Pakalapati et al., 2006] To examine whether three cycles of a low-intensity chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide [500 mg/m(2) - day 1], vinblastine [6 mg/m(2) - days 1 and 8] and prednisolone [40 mg/m(2) - days 1-7] (CVP) is safe and therapeutically effective in children and adolescents with early stage nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma [nLPHL]. Fifty-five children and adolescents with early stage nLPHL [median age 13 years, range 4-17 years] diagnosed between June 2005 and October 2010 in the UK and France are the subjects of this report. Staging investigations included conventional cross sectional as well as 18 fluro-deoxyglucose [FDG] PET imaging. Histology was confirmed as nLPHL by an expert pathology panel. Of the 45 patients, who received CVP as first line treatment, 36 [80%, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: (68; 92)] either achieved a complete remission [CR] or CR unconfirmed [CRu], the remaining nine patients achieved a partial response. All nine subsequently achieved CR with salvage chemotherapy [n=7] or radiotherapy [n=2]. Ten patients received CVP at relapse after primary treatment that consisted of surgery alone and all achieved CR. To date, only three patients have relapsed after CVP chemotherapy and all had received CVP as first line treatment at initial diagnosis. The 40-month freedom from treatment failure and overall survival for the entire cohort were 75.4% (SE ± 6%) and 100%, respectively. No significant early toxicity was observed. Our results show that CVP is an effective chemotherapy regimen in children and adolescents with early stage nLPHL that is well tolerated with minimal acute toxicity. [PMID: 22093944, Ananth Shankar et al., 2012] The authors evaluated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of extended-release venlafaxine in the treatment of pediatric generalized anxiety disorder. Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were conducted at 59 sites in 2000 and 2001. Participants 6 to 17 years of age who met DSM-IV criteria for generalized anxiety disorder received a flexible dosage of extended-release venlafaxine (N=157) or placebo (N=163) for 8 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the composite score for nine delineated items from the generalized anxiety disorder section of a modified version of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children, and the primary efficacy variable was the baseline-to-endpoint change in this composite score. Secondary outcome measures were overall score on the nine delineated items, Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders, and the severity of illness and improvement scores from the Clinical Global Impression scale (CGI). The extended-release venlafaxine group showed statistically significant improvements in the primary and secondary outcome measures in study 1 and significant improvements in some secondary outcome measures but not the primary outcome measure in study 2. In a pooled analysis, the extended-release venlafaxine group showed a significantly greater mean decrease in the primary outcome measure compared with the placebo group (-17.4 versus -12.7). The response rate as indicated by a CGI improvement score <3 was significantly greater with extended-release venlafaxine than placebo (69% versus 48%). Common adverse events were asthenia, anorexia, pain, and somnolence. Statistically significant changes in height, weight, blood pressure, pulse, and cholesterol levels were observed in the extended-release venlafaxine group. Extended-release venlafaxine may be an effective, well-tolerated short-term treatment for pediatric generalized anxiety disorder. [PMID: 17267793, Moira A Rynn et al., 2007] The efficacy of the fluoroquinolone levofloxacin in the treatment of 35 children with bronchopulmonary disease exacerbation was practically the same as that of amoxycillin/clavulanate, cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. The clinical and bacteriological results were favourable. The eradication of the pathogens responsible for the bronchopulmonary inflammations in 86% of the patients was stated. There is no doubt that fluoroquinolones should not be widely used in pediatrics. They should be considered as reserve drugs for the treatment of severe cases when the routine agents fail. Their use is justified when the situation is risky and the data on the pathogen susceptibility to the drugs are available. Still, levofloxacin is the most safe fluoroquinolone with low hepatotoxicity and lower effect on the central nervous system. The episodes of its negative cardiovascular action are less frequent. Moreover, the most frequent side effects of fluoroquinolones such as nausea, diarrhea or vomiting are less frequent with the use of levofloxacin. No signs of arthropathy in the patients treated with levofloxacin were observed in our trial. [PMID: 15690910, I K Volkov et al., 2004]
